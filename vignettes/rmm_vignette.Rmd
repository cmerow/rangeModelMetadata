##What is an rmm (rangeModelMetadata) object?

A simple `rmm` object is a list object that is structured to contain metadata pertaining to species range models. Here we make an empty `rmm` object containing only the obligate set of fields.
```{r}
rmm1=rmmTemplate(family=c('obligate')) 
str(rmm1)
```

A more complex `rmm` object with all predefined fields. It may seem like a lot at first, but we're trying to keep you all happy, and many of these won't be needed. As we explore the hierarchy below, it'll seem simpler...
```{r}
rmm2=rmmTemplate(family=NULL)
str(rmm2)
```

##Populating an rmm object

`rmm` objects can be populated manually by entering data direcetly into the fields, or through the use of several helper functions.  Although the `rmm` object template already contains a number of fields that depend on the specified `family`, users can also add new fields as needed.  We provide suggestions of both common fields to add and common values for many fields.

Not sure what to enter in different fields? We can suggest options.

```{r}
rmmSuggest('dataPrep',fullFieldDepth=FALSE)
rmmSuggest('dataPrep',fullFieldDepth=TRUE) # for all fields below the specified one
rmmSuggest('dataPrep$errors$duplicateRemoval')
rmmSuggest('dataPrep$errors$duplicateRemoval$rule')
```

Another more complex example:

```{r}
rmmSuggest('model')
rmmSuggest('model$maxent$')
rmmSuggest('$model$maxent$featureSet')
```


To make it easier to fill some `rmm` fields, we provide autofill functions that extract relevant information from common R objects used in a range modeling workflow. Also see `vignette('rmm_workflow')` for a demonstration of how to fill in metadata during an SDM workflow.

```{r}
rmm=rmmTemplate()
rmm=rmmAutofillPackageCitation(rmm,c('raster','sp'))
# search GBIF for occurrence data to demonstrate the autofill function
bv=spocc::occ('Bradypus variegatus', 'gbif', limit=50, has_coords=TRUE)
rmm=rmmAutofillspocc(rmm,bv$gbif)
# get some env layers to demonstrate the autofill function
rasterFiles=list.files(path=paste(system.file(package='dismo'), '/ex', sep=''),
                       pattern='grd', full.names=TRUE)
# make a stack of the rasters
env=raster::stack(rasterFiles)
rmm=rmmAutofillEnvironment(rmm,env,transfer=0) # for fitting environment
# just using the same rasters for demonstration; in practice these are different
rmm=rmmAutofillEnvironment(rmm,env,transfer=1) # for transfer environment 1
rmm=rmmAutofillEnvironment(rmm,env,transfer=2) # for transfer environment 2 
```

To see what fields you might've missed...
```{r}
empties=rmmCheckEmpty(rmm)
```
<!-- # rmmCleanEmpties(rmm) -->

##Checking an rmm object

To check the field names in your object, use the function `rmmNameCheck`

```{r}
# Make an empty template
rmm1<-rmmTemplate() 
# Add a new, non-standard field
rmm1$dataPrep$biological$taxonomicHarmonization$taxonomy_source<-"The Plant List" # # Checking the names identifies the new, non-standard field we've added ("taxonomy_source")
rmm1=rmmCheckName(rmm1) 
```

To check the field values in your rmm object, use the function `rmmValueCheck`
```{r}
#First, we create an empty rmm template
rmm1<-rmmTemplate() 
#We add 3 of the bioclim layers, including a spelling error (an extra space) in bio2, and a word that is clearly not a climate layer, 'cromulent'.
rmm1$data$environment$variableNames<- c("bio1", "bio 2", "bio3", "cromulent") 
#Now, when we check the values, we see that bio1 and bio2 are reported as exact matches, while 'bio 2' is flagged as a partial match with a suggested value of 'bio2', and 'cromulent' is flagged as not matched at all.
rmmCheckValue(rmm = rmm1) 
#If we'd like to return a dataframe containing this information in a perhaps more useful format:
rmmCheckValueOutput<-rmmCheckValue(rmm = rmm1,returnData = TRUE)
```

  <!-- names<-rmmCheckName(rmm,returnData = T) -->

  <!-- values<-rmmCheckValue(rmm = rmm,returnData = T) -->

  <!-- missing_names<-rmmCheckMissingNames(rmm,useCase = useCase) -->

  <!-- empty_values<-rmmCheckEmpty(rmm = rmm,useCase = useCase) -->


These 'check' functions work by comparing the values or names within an `rmm` object to those in a data dictionary.  These functions are designed to check for non-standard values and names, and DO NOT necessarily identify correct vs. incorrect values/names.  Non-standard values may be perfectly valid, or they may be erroneous, and the user will have to make this distinction.

To run all the available checks at once, we'll check the object that we filled in a few chunks back.
```{r}
# rmmCheckFinalize(rmm, family=c('base','obligate'))
```


##Outputing an `rmm` object

To make `rmm` objects portable to other interfaces, they are readily written to csv format.
```{r,eval=F}
outFile='~/Desktop/demo_rmmToCSV.csv'
rmmObj=rmmTemplate()
rmmToCSV(rmmObj,filename=outFile)
system(paste0('open ', outFile, ' -a "Microsoft Excel"'))
```


## Miscellaneous

It can be helpful to simply view the data dictionary:

```{r}
dd=rmmDataDictionary()
str(dd)
# rmmDataDictionary(excel=TRUE) # try this if you have excel
```
