Description:  Range Modeling Metadata Standards (RMMS) address three challenges: they (i) are designed for convenience to encourage use, (ii) accommodate a wide variety of applications, and (iii) are extensible to allow the community of range modelers to steer it as needed. RMMS are based on a data dictionary that specifies a hierarchical structure to catalog different aspects of the range modeling process. The dictionary balances a constrained, minimalist vocabulary to improve standardization with flexibility for users to provide their own values.
