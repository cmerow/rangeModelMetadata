Adv.:The gold standard for the spatial and temporal resolution of predictor variables is to match the spatial resolution at which the response variable is affected by the predictors [see 1D]. Choosing an inappropriate spatial resolution can obscure the species– environment relationship and result in reduced predictive ability (113, 114). In addition, temporal resolution should match the biology of the response variable. For example, for seasonally migrating species, predictor variables should provide information throughout the year, rather than annual averages (115). Similarly, because the spatial distributions of many taxa show delayed responses to changes in predictor variables (116-120), analysis of historical time periods may provide better insights (94, 96, 97). Adjusting the spatial resolution of predictor variables to an appropriate (theoretically justified) resolution by downscaling or interpolation (65) is only acceptable when direct measurements are unavailable."

As a gold standard, the efficacy of the bias correction can be assessed by comparison with independent data, such as from high quality surveys in different regions or times. The silver standard approach to bias correction weights the data by their reliability, and assesses the result through internal cross-validation.
